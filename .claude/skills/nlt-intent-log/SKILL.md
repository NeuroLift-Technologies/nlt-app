# NLT Intent Log (OTOI Section 7)

This skill guides agents through creating an **intent log entry** as required by ORG-DEV-OTOI-1.0.0 Section 7. Log your intent before acting, then record the outcome afterward.

The `/intent-log <topic>` slash command automates this workflow.

## When to Use

- Before any action with broad scope or architectural impact
- Before any irreversible action (deletes, force-pushes, schema changes)
- Before touching files outside your immediate task scope
- When you are unsure whether an action requires escalation

## Where to Store

```
docs/agent-log/intent/[date]-[topic].md
```

## What Qualifies as "Significant"?

- **Broad scope** — affects many files, services, or people
- **Irreversible** — difficult or impossible to undo
- **Architectural** — changes how systems are structured or interact
- **Sensitive** — involves credentials, access controls, or PII

When in doubt, log it. Intent logging costs little and protects everyone.

## Decision Flowchart

```
Significant action identified?
        |
        v
Write intent log entry
        |
        v
Escalation needed? --yes--> Stop; /escalate <topic>
        |
       no
        |
        v
Proceed with action
        |
        v
Fill in Outcome section
```
