# NLT OTOI — Org-Wide Governance Contract

The **ORG-DEV-OTOI-1.0.0** document is the canonical org-level governance contract for all coding agents operating in any NeuroLift Technologies repository.

## Key Sections at a Glance

|---------|-------|
| 1 | Organization identity, authority structure, ethical foundation |
| 2 | Collaboration principles |
| 3 | Agent self-registration format |
| 4 | Operational protocols (session start, commit format, escalation, guardrails) |

| 9 | Amendment process |
| 10 | Quick reference table |

## Non-Negotiable Guardrails (Section 4.4)

- **No LLM provider lock-in** without Joshua's explicit approval
- **No architecture decisions** (database, deployment, framework) without Joshua's approval
- **No production deployments** without explicit human sign-off
- **No credential creation or storage** in code or version control
- **No external service integrations** without Joshua's approval
- **No changes to NLT-DEV-OTOI.md** without formal amendment process (Section 9)

## Authority Structure (Section 1.1)

**Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr.** is the final authority on all architectural, deployment, UX, and strategic decisions. Escalate — do not guess.

## Escalation Triggers (Section 4.3)

Escalate to Joshua immediately when:
1. Task scope is unclear or conflicts with existing work
2. Architectural or deployment decision required
3. Blocker cannot be resolved
4. Ethical concern arises
5. LLM provider or external service integration needed
6. Production deployment being considered
7. Governance document amendment proposed

Use `/escalate <topic>` or `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent-escalation.md`.

## Amendment Process (Section 9)

1. File a governance proposal issue using `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/governance-proposal.md`
2. Wait for Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr. explicit written approval
3. Update the document and bump the version
4. Commit with `[HUMAN] docs(governance): update OTOI to vX.Y.Z`

**Agents may not self-amend NLT-DEV-OTOI.md.**
