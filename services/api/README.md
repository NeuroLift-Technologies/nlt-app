# Simulation API Service

This service now includes a runnable FastAPI starter wired to the existing Python simulation domain.

## Intent and architecture

`services/api/` is the service boundary between client applications and the Python simulation
domain in `src/`. Client surfaces should call this API instead of importing Avatar, Aide, or
orchestrator classes directly.

Current source path:

```text
services/api/app/main.py             # FastAPI routes
services/api/app/schemas.py          # Pydantic request/response models
services/api/app/session_service.py  # Adapter into src.simulation.session_orchestrator
src/simulation/session_orchestrator.py
```

The starter currently runs `StayAlertAvatar` with `AttentionCoaching` through
`SessionOrchestrator`. It does not yet provide authentication, persistence, CORS middleware,
or multi-avatar selection.

## Endpoints

- `GET /health` — service health
- `GET /sessions/demo-run` — run built-in demo scenarios
- `POST /sessions/run` — run a custom session payload

## Request and response contract

`POST /sessions/run` accepts:

```json
{
  "avatar_id": "stay_alert_api",
  "aide_id": "stay_alert_aide_api",
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "name": "Morning planning sprint",
      "task_type": "planning",
      "base_success_rate": 0.55,
      "cognitive_demand": 0.65
    }
  ]
}
```

Scenario constraints are enforced by `ScenarioInput`:

- `name` is required.
- `task_type` defaults to `focus_task`.
- `base_success_rate` and `cognitive_demand` must be between `0.0` and `1.0`.

Responses are serialized `SessionResult` payloads with:

- session and participant IDs (`session_id`, `avatar_id`, `aide_id`)
- aggregate metrics (`total_attempts`, `total_successes`, `total_coaching`, `success_rate`)
- final state (`final_independence`, `fusion_ready`)
- per-scenario result dictionaries under `scenarios`

## Local run

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn services.api.app.main:app --reload
```

Smoke checks:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/sessions/demo-run
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sessions/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scenarios":[{"name":"Quick focus drill"}]}'
```

## Developer pitfalls

- Browser clients served from another origin, such as `http://localhost:4173`, will need CORS
  support before their fetches can succeed in a real browser. No CORS middleware is configured
  in `services/api/app/main.py` yet.
- `GET /sessions/demo-run` and `POST /sessions/run` execute an in-process simulation on each
  request; there is no job queue or persisted session store yet.
- The current API adapter always uses the sustained-attention Avatar/Aide pair. `avatar_id` and
  `aide_id` label the returned run but do not select different implementations yet.
- Keep API schemas aligned with `packages/simulation-sdk/src/types.ts` when request or response
  fields change.

## Why this matters

This API is the integration seam for both web and mobile applications, so clients do not directly couple to `src/` internals.
